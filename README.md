# Folder structure 

The repository accompanying this thesis is structured into three main folders to facilitate reproducibility and organization. 
The first folder contains the implementation of the two MCMC algorithms developed as part of this work: the adaptive MCMC and the Birth-Death MCMC (BDMCMC). 
Alongside the algorithm code, this folder also includes an example demonstrating their usage to guide users in applying the methods to their own data. 
The second folder is dedicated to the Figures and Tables that are central to the analysis and results presented in the thesis.  The third component of the repository is the [TEX file](./thesis.tex) of the thesis itself, which can be compiled given the provided folder structure.
